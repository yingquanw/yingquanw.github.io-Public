                        On May 1st 2022, I finished my first half-marathon
                        under 2 hours in BMO Vancouver Marathon Event and that was probably one of the joyful moments 
                        in my life. I want to take this one step further so I plan to do the full 42.195km marathon next
                        year. I am currently training for this to prepare myself to this goal which I would say impossibe
                        1 year ago. The habit of running really changed my life.

                    <p>
                        I started to play soccer when I was about 14 and was the captain of my high school soccer team.
                        My best position is center back although I can also be the goal keeper.
                        I support Liverpool football club and my favorite player in the team is Mohammed Salah.

                        I like board games becuase it is exciting while also releaxing. The games I spent most time 
                        on are Twillight Struggle, Carcassonne and Splendor.
